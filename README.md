**ztail** is an efficient command-line tool to display the last N lines of compressed `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, and `.zst` files. Designed for high performance, **ztail** is ideal for working with large compressed text files.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**

- **Supports `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, and `.zst` Files:** Decompresses and processes these compressed file formats efficiently.
- **Automatic Detection:** Compression type is identified from file contents even when the extension is missing or wrong.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for large files, avoiding unnecessary full decompressions.
- **Intuitive Command-Line Interface:** Simple usage with flexible options.
- **Efficient Ring Buffer:** Uses a CharRingBuffer backend by default. Build with `-DUSE_CHAR_RING_BUFFER=OFF` to
  switch to the slower std::string-based buffer for debugging purposes.

## üì¶ **Installation**

### üìã **Prerequisites**

- **C++17** or higher.
- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher).
- **zlib Library:** For decompressing `.gz` and `.bgz` files.
- **bzip2 Library:** For handling `.bz2` files.
 - **liblzma Library:** For handling `.xz` files.
 - **libzstd Library:** For handling `.zst` files.
 - **libzip Library:** For handling `.zip` files.

On Ubuntu/Debian the required packages can typically be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libzstd-dev libzip-dev
```

Library names may vary on other operating systems.

### üîß **Build Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acpguedes/ztail.git
   cd ztail
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory and Navigate Into It:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Configure the Project with CMake:**

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
   ```

   To generate a portable binary that avoids CPU-specific optimizations, enable the
   `BUILD_PORTABLE` option:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_PORTABLE=ON
   ```

   On systems without thread support, disable the producer/consumer threads with:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DZTAIL_USE_THREADS=OFF
   ```

   Threads can also be disabled at runtime with the `--no-threads` option.

   The high-performance CharRingBuffer backend is enabled by default. To use the previous
   std::string-based implementation for debugging, disable it with:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DUSE_CHAR_RING_BUFFER=OFF
   ```

4. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `ztail` executable inside the `build` directory.

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Display the Last N Lines of `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, or `.zst` Files**

```bash
./ztail -n 2 file.gz
./ztail -n 2 -c 1024 file.gz
./ztail -n 2 file.bgz
./ztail -n 2 file.bz2
./ztail -n 2 file.xz
./ztail -n 2 file.zip
./ztail -n 2 file.zst
./ztail -e entry.txt archive.zip
./ztail --version
./ztail --help
```

- **`-n N`, `--lines N`**: Display the last N lines (default = 10).
- **`-c N`, `--line-capacity N`**: Pre-reserve N bytes for each line to reduce reallocations (default = 0).
- **`-b N`, `--zlib-buffer N`**: Set zlib buffer size in bytes (default = 1048576).
- **`--xz-buffer N`**: Set xz buffer size in bytes (default = 32768).
- **`--zstd-window N`**: Set maximum zstd window size in bytes (default = unlimited).
- **`-r N`, `--read-buffer N`**: Set read buffer size in bytes (default = 1048576).
- **`--no-threads`**: Disable producer/consumer threads.
- **`file.gz`, `file.bgz`, `file.bz2`, `file.xz`, `file.zip`, or `file.zst`**: Name of the compressed file. The extension may be omitted because compression type is detected automatically.
- **`-e <name>`, `--entry <name>`**: When reading a `.zip` file, select an entry inside the archive.
- If no file is provided, **ztail** reads from standard input.
- **`-V`, `--version`**: Display program version and exit.
- **`-h`, `--help`**: Display usage information and exit.

## üí° **Suggested Use Cases**

1. **Quick inspection of huge files**
   - *Problem:* Compressed files (`.gz`, `.bgz`, `.zip`) with tens or hundreds of gigabytes.
   - *Reason:* Using `zcat | tail` forces a full read/decompression, which can take minutes or hours.
   - *Where it's useful:* Server or application logs, database dumps exported with gzip, and large bioinformatics files (FASTQ, VCF) to verify integrity at the end.

2. **Processing in I/O-limited environments**
   - *Problem:* Slow storage (S3, NFS, spinning disks, high-latency networks).
   - *Reason:* Less reading means less waiting time.
   - *Where it's useful:* Cloud environments with per-read costs (e.g., S3 Glacier) and remote servers over SSH with restricted bandwidth.

3. **Diagnostics in data pipelines**
   - *Problem:* In ETL/ELT, often only the end of the file matters for debugging (last processed batch).
   - *Reason:* Avoids processing unnecessary data and speeds up debugging.
   - *Where it's useful:* Data pipeline CI/CD and near real-time ingestion monitoring.

4. **Bioinformatics and scientific data**
   - *Problem:* Sequencing files, simulation logs, and scientific time series tend to be enormous.
   - *Reason:* The end often reveals the result of a batch or run.
   - *Where it's useful:* Compressed FASTQ, BAM, VCF files and outputs from meteorological or computational physics simulators.

5. **Compatibility and portability**
   - Works like `tail` for compressed files without requiring complex tools like Spark, Hadoop, or Pandas.
   - Can be integrated into existing shell scripts, including minimal Unix environments.

## üß™ **Tests**

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run them:

1. **Ensure the project was configured with testing enabled:**

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

3. **Execute the Tests:**

   ```bash
   ctest --output-on-failure
   ```
