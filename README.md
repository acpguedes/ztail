# ztail

**ztail** is an efficient command-line tool to display the last N lines of compressed `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, and `.zst` files. Designed for high performance, **ztail** is ideal for working with large compressed text files.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**

- **Supports `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, and `.zst` Files:** Decompresses and processes these compressed file formats efficiently.
- **Automatic Detection:** Compression type is identified from file contents even when the extension is missing or wrong.
- **High Performance:** Optimized for large files, avoiding unnecessary full decompressions.
- **Intuitive Command-Line Interface:** Simple usage with flexible options.

## üì¶ **Installation**

### üìã **Prerequisites**

- **C++17** or higher.
- **CMake** (version 3.10 or higher).
- **zlib Library:** For decompressing `.gz` and `.bgz` files.
- **bzip2 Library:** For handling `.bz2` files.
 - **liblzma Library:** For handling `.xz` files.
 - **libzstd Library:** For handling `.zst` files.
 - **libzip Library:** For handling `.zip` files.

On Ubuntu/Debian the required packages can typically be installed with:

```bash
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev libzstd-dev libzip-dev
```

Library names may vary on other operating systems.

### üîß **Build Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acpguedes/ztail.git
   cd ztail
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory and Navigate Into It:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Configure the Project with CMake:**

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
   ```

   To generate a portable binary that avoids CPU-specific optimizations, enable the
   `BUILD_PORTABLE` option:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_PORTABLE=ON
   ```

4. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `ztail` executable inside the `build` directory.

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Display the Last N Lines of `.gz`, `.bgz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`, `.zip`, or `.zst` Files**

```bash
./ztail -n 2 file.gz
./ztail -n 2 -c 1024 file.gz
./ztail -n 2 file.bgz
./ztail -n 2 file.bz2
./ztail -n 2 file.xz
./ztail -n 2 file.zip
./ztail -n 2 file.zst
./ztail -e entry.txt archive.zip
./ztail --version
./ztail --help
```

- **`-n N`, `--lines N`**: Display the last N lines (default = 10).
- **`-c N`, `--line-capacity N`**: Pre-reserve N bytes for each line to reduce reallocations (default = 0).
- **`file.gz`, `file.bgz`, `file.bz2`, `file.xz`, `file.zip`, or `file.zst`**: Name of the compressed file. The extension may be omitted because compression type is detected automatically.
- **`-e <name>`, `--entry <name>`**: When reading a `.zip` file, select an entry inside the archive.
- If no file is provided, **ztail** reads from standard input.
- **`-V`, `--version`**: Display program version and exit.
- **`-h`, `--help`**: Display usage information and exit.

## üß™ **Tests**

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. To run them:

1. **Ensure the project was configured with testing enabled:**

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Build Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd build
   ```

3. **Execute the Tests:**

   ```bash
   ctest --output-on-failure
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Considerations**

- **Input Validation:** Ensure file paths and inputs are validated to prevent vulnerabilities such as path traversal.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage unexpected scenarios gracefully.
- **Dependency Management:** Keep dependencies up-to-date to mitigate potential security risks.

## üèÜ **Development Highlights**

Over time **ztail** evolved through several improvements:

- Modularized codebase and introduced continuous integration with tests.
- Added bzip2 and xz support, expanding beyond gzip.
- Implemented automatic compression detection using magic bytes.
- Introduced an `ICompressor` interface with RAII wrappers for safe resource management.
- Enhanced CLI validation and clarified documentation with installation instructions.
- Updated GitHub workflows and dependencies for reliable builds.
